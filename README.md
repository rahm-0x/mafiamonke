# Mafia Monkes – NFT & Token Ecosystem

Welcome to **Mafia Monkes**—an exclusive NFT & token ecosystem designed to transform the world of decentralized luxury. This repository houses the front-end React application, built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

Mafia Monkes (MMC) merges **NFT** collections, **tokenomics**, and a vibrant **community** to offer real-life utility and next-level experiences on chains like **Solana** and **Magic Eden**. This codebase showcases a sleek landing page with sections for Ecosystem, Tokenomics, Roadmap, FAQ, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahm-0x/mafiamonke.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   cd mafiamonke
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run locally**:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app runs in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Structure

- **`src/components`**: Contains all React components (Navbar, Hero, Ecosystem, Tokenomics, Roadmap, FAQ, Footer, etc.).
- **`src/imgs`**: Houses PNGs and other image assets for the Ecosystem cards and more.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Tailwind CSS configuration, controlling theme, colors, and custom utilities.
- **`App.js`**: Main entry point that composes all components in a single-page layout.
- **`CountdownTimer.jsx`**: A custom countdown component for the NFT Mint countdown.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the usual Create React App commands:

- **`npm start`**  
  Launches the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- **`npm run build`**  
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing React for best performance.

- **`npm test`**  
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

- **`npm run eject`**  
  **One-way operation**: Copies all config files for deeper customization. Use with caution.
